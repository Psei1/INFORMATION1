<h1>BIO</h1>
<p style="font-size:120%;"> I am 20 years old, I studied in National University Fairview, My course is Bachelor of Science in Information Technology With Specialization in Mobile and Internet Technologies. I choose this course because it's related to my passion in computers but what I really want is the one about the hardware but I also liked this course because it's super challenging and brain draining but honestly I can't really do it anymore.  Also a introvert but if you talk to me first that's the way we will become friends. I spend a lot of time in gaming but I still responsible on household and errands.
